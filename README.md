## What (it does)?
It allows you to store information snippets (URLs, code, notes, etc.) and add keywords to find and access them again from everywhere.

## Why (did I create this)?
There are three reasons:
- I use google keep for small, short-living snippets of information as well as for notifications. I use OneNote for (structured) stuff I actually work on. But there's nothing in between... I need a tool to store more or less unstructured stuff, that I want to keep (so longer living than keep ;)) but without all the boilerplate from OneNote.
- I wanted to try the React-Node-MongoDB stack.
- I wanted to have a go at implementing and thinking about a decent UX concept.

## Technologies, libraries, etc.
The aim is to use only libraries, that are really necessary. And to do the UI/UX stuff myself and not rely on things like Material or Office UI Fabric, etc.
